Here is a readme file about linear regression with pyspark:

# Linear Regression with PySpark

This project demonstrates how to perform linear regression using PySpark, a Python API for Apache Spark. PySpark allows us to use Spark's distributed computing framework with Python's data analysis and machine learning libraries.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Ecommerce_Customers Dataset, which contains information about the Customer Time spend on each website . The dataset has 1000 observations and 7 variables, including Yearly Amount Spent as the target variable.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you will need the following Python packages:

- pyspark
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install them using pip or conda.

## Steps

The main steps of this project are:

1. Load and explore the dataset using PySpark's DataFrame API.
2. Preprocess the dataset by splitting it into training and testing sets, and standardizing the features.
3. Build and train a linear regression model using PySpark's MLlib library.
4. Evaluate the model performance using various metrics, such as root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2).
5. Visualize the model predictions and residuals using matplotlib and seaborn.

## Code

The code for this project is available in the `linear_regression.py` file. You can run it using the following command:

```bash
spark-submit linear_regression.py
The code will output the model summary, the evaluation metrics, and the plots of the predictions and residuals.
